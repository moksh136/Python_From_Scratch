Student Registration System – Longest Name

A school is organizing an inter-school cultural event. During the registration process, the coordinator notices that some students have very long names, which may not fit properly on the printed ID cards.

As a software developer, your task is to write a Python program that identifies the student with the longest name from the list of registered students using the reduce() function along with a lambda expression.

Input
students = ["Riya", "Christopher", "Aman", "Neha", "Siddharth"]
Expected Output
Student with the longest name: Christophe"""

students = ["Riya", "Christopher", "Aman", "Neha", "Siddharth"]
from functools import reduce
students = ["Riya", "Christopher", "Aman", "Neha", "Siddharth"]
res = reduce(lambda x,y:x if len(x)>len(y) else y, students)
print(res)
