""" Student Grade Classification System (Python List Assignment)


A school stores student marks in a list. The system must analyze the marks and generate a *clear performance report* 
by grouping students into grade categories.



Write a Python program to:

* Iterate through the list of marks
* Assign grades based on marks:

  * *>= 90 → A*
  * *>= 75 and < 90 → B*
  * *>= 50 and < 75 → C*
  * *< 50 → Fail*
* Store each category in separate lists
* Count students in each category
* Display a *final structured report (important)*

## 📌 Output Format (Mandatory)

Your output must be displayed exactly in this format:


===== STUDENT GRADE REPORT =====

A Grade Students   : [list]
B Grade Students   : [list]
C Grade Students   : [list]
Fail Students      : [list]

--------------------------------
A Count   : X
B Count   : X
C Count   : X
Fail Count: X
--------------------------------

Total Students: X

 Input

[95, 82, 67, 45, 30]
