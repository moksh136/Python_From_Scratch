Social Media Trend Analysis System
A social media company analyzes hashtags and user comments to identify trending character patterns.
The analytics team wants a Python program to find the character with the second highest frequency in a given string.
This helps detect secondary trending patterns in user activity.

Output:
e
Explanation:
b occurs 4 times → highest
e occurs 3 times → second highest
Condition:
Program should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Spaces should be ignored.
If no second highest frequency exists, print:
